# Notes-on-Survival-Models

This R markdown notebook is intended to review some of the concepts behind survival models. It will also 
help me to maintain a consistent notation for survival models that I can use in my projects.

These notes are heavily based off of "Bayesian Survival Analysis" by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinha.
