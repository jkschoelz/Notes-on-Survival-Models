I am working to get a better handle on survival modeling, and want to write up a little of what I have seen so far. In survival modeling we are analyzing "time to event". So we have some event, either a death, occurence of a disease, failure of a mechanical part, and we are interested how long it takes for the event to occur. In this notebook, I am going to try and lay out some of the basic ideas behind survival analysis. We will be using the notation adopted by Ibrahim *et al* in their book *Bayesian Survival Analysis*.

# Terminology

Let $T$ be a continous random variable that represents the time until the event of interest happens for the individual in question. We can define $f(t)$ to be the probability density function (pdf) describing the distribution of $~T$. Let $F(t)$ be the cumulative desnity function defined as

$$
F(t) = Pr(T \leq t) = \int_{0}^{t}f(u)du
$$

We can also define a function $S(t)$ called the survival function defined as

$$
S(t) = 1 - F(t) = Pr(T>t)
$$

The survival function $S(t)$ then is just the probability of surviving until time $t$.

We can define one more function called the hazard function. The hazard function is roughly a measure of the risk that the event will occur in a given time interval. We define the hazard function as 

$$
h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{Pr(t <T \leq t+\Delta t | t<T)}{\Delta t}
$$

By manipulating this expression, we can rewrite the hazard function in a more familiar form. Using Bayes' rule we can rewrite as a joint probability

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
h(t) =& &\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} &\frac{Pr(t <T, T \leq t+\Delta t | t<T)}{\Delta t} \\
=& &\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} &\frac{Pr(T<t+\Delta t | t<T)}{\Delta t} \\
=& &\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} &\frac{Pr(T<t+\Delta t , t<T )}{Pr(t<T)\Delta t} \\
=& &\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} &\frac{Pr(t<T<t+\Delta t )}{S(t)\Delta t} \\
=& &\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} &\frac{f(t)\Delta t}{S(t)\Delta t}\\
=& & &\frac{f(t)}{S(t)} \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Since $f(t) = \frac{dF}{dt} = -\frac{dS}{dt}$ we can express the survival function in terms of the hazard as 

$$
h(t) = -\frac{1}{S(t)}\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\\
$$

So we have a first order differential equation. Solving the equation, we can write the survival function $S(t)$ in terms of the hazard function $h(t)$. Then

$$
S(t) = \exp \left( - \int_{0}^{t} h(u)du\right) \\ 
$$

Sometimes it is helpful to define a cumulative hazard function

$$
H(t) = \int_{0}^{t} h(u)du
$$

what is going on here
 
## Right censored data

Many times, we do not have either the time or the resources to record data the whole time. In this case, some of the individuals will go through the entire observed period without experiencing an event. We refer to this as the data being right-censored. We want to write down the liklihood of a set of parameters given some data. Suppose the survival data for the $i\text{th}$ individual is given by $(y_{i}, \nu_{i})$ where $y_{i}$ is the last known survival time, and $\nu_{i}$ is an indicator that tells you whether the data has been censored or not. If $\nu_{i} = 1$ we have a censored event. If $\nu_{i}=0$ then data is uncensored and the event time $y_{i}$ is actually the true event time. Suppose we have $N$ individuals. Then in this censored model, the liklihood of the data given model parameters is 

$$
\mathcal{L} = \prod_{i=1}^{N}f(y_{i})^{1-\nu_{i}}S(y_{i})^{\nu_{i}}
$$


Lets look at some specific examples.

# Hazard function examples
## Parameterized Models: Exponential

What happens if we choose a constant hazard function? Let's let our hazard function be constant, given by

$$
h(t) = a
$$

Then the cumulative hazard will be 

$$
H(t) = \int_{0}^{t}a d\tau = at
$$
And our survival function is

$$
S(t) = e^{-H(t)} = e^{-at}
$$

From the survival function we can get the cumulative distibution function

$$
F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 -e^{-at}
$$

Lastly, we can get the probability density function for the events as

$$
f(t) = \frac{F(t)}{dt} = -\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = ae^{-at}
$$

## Parameterized Models: Weibull

The Weibull distribution is often used in Survival modeling for the probability density function. It is a particularly flexible function. Twe Weibull distribution is given as 

$$
f(t;\alpha, \sigma) = \frac{\sigma}{\alpha}\left( \frac{t}{\alpha} \right)^{\sigma - 1}\exp \left( \frac{t}{\alpha}\right)^{\sigma}
$$

We can integrate to get the cumulative density function 

$$
F(t; \alpha, \sigma) = 1 - \left( \frac{t}{\alpha}\right)^{\sigma}\exp \left( \frac{t}{\alpha} \right)^{\sigma }
$$

Then our Survival function will be given by 

$$
S(t; \alpha, \sigma) = \left( \frac{t}{\alpha}\right)^{\sigma}\exp \left( \frac{t}{\alpha} \right)^{\sigma}
$$

Using the probability density and the Survival function we can find the Weibull hazard function

$$
h(t; \alpha, \sigma) = \frac{f(t; \alpha, \sigma)}{S(t; \alpha, \sigma)} = \frac{\sigma}{\alpha^{\sigma}}t^{\sigma - 1}
$$
The cumulative hazard is given by

$$
H(t; \alpha, \sigma) =\left( \frac{t}{\alpha}\right)^{\sigma}
$$
With the cumulative Hazard function we can see the flexibility of the solution. $\alpha$ serves as a scale parameter. $\sigma$ is the shape parameter. If $\sigma = 1$, then the cumulative hazard increases linearly, and we essentially recover the constant hazard model from before. If $\sigma >1 $ the hazard grows with time. If $\sigma < 1$ the hazard shrinks with time. So this is a relatively flexible model, capable of describing a lot of interesting behavior.
